# Chatroom
Cross platform networking test

An attempt to develop a console-only cross-platform chatroom, with features like file transfer and chat rooms with an active listing, rather than plain old "one-to-one" direct connections.

Work in progress, really want to spend some more time on this but haven't been able to recently.
